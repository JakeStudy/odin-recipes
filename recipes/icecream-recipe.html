    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This silly, luscious and very classic custard can be used as the base for
      any ice cream flavor you can dream up. These particular proportions of
      milk and cream to egg yolk will give you a thick but not sticky ice cream
      that feels descadent but not heavy. For something a little lighter, use
      more milk and less cream, as long as the dairy adds up to 3 cups. You can
      also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, but don't go below three.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><b>Yield:</b> about 1 and half pints</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
      <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>Your choice of flavoring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar, and salt until sugar
        completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. in a
        separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a
        third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back
        into the pot with the cream. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently
        cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about
        170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer)
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room
        temperature. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an
        ice cream machine according to manufacturere's instructions. Serve
        directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until
        needed.

        Tip This recipe for icecream base may be churned on its own, but it is
        meant to have flavors added. See the chart here for flavor options and
        directions for incorporating them into the base recipe.
