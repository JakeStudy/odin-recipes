    <h3>For the Macarons</h3>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        Sift the confectioners sugar and almond flour into a bowl
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Add the room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites. Once they begin to foam add
        the cream of tartar and then SLOWLY add the granulated sugar.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Add the food coloring (if desired) and vanilla then mix in. Continue to
        beat until stiff peaks form.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Begin folding in the 1/3 of the dry ingredients.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Be careful to add the remaining dry ingredients and fold gently.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        The final mixture should look like flowing lava, and be able to fall
        into a figure eight without breaking. Spoon into a piping bag with a
        medium round piping tip and you're ready to start piping.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Pipe on inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tap
        on counter several times to release air bubbles. Allow to sit for about
        40 minutes before packing in oven.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Bake at 300F for 12-15 minutes, rotate tray after 7 minutes. Allow to
        cool completely before removing from baking sheet.
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the French Buttercream Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine sugar and water in medium saucepan. Heat over low heat while
        stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium- high and bring
        to a boil
      </li>
      <li>
        Put egg uolks in a stand-mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat
        until thick and foamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the sugar and water syrup until it reaches 240 degrees F.
        Immediately remove from heat. With mixer running, SLOWLY drizzle hot
        syrupt into bowl with yolks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue mixing until the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch and
        the yolk mixture has cooled to room temerature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in butter one cube at a time allowing each piece to incorporate
        before adding the next. Add vanilla and salt. Continue mixing until
        buttercream is smooth and creamy. (about5-6 minutes.) Add food coloring
        if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For assembly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pipe your filling onto the back of hal the shells. Form a sandwich and
        repeat. Macarons should be aged in the fridge for 1-3 days for best
        results. This allows the filling to soften the shells inside.
